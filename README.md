# Road-To-Modding
I am a student who desires to build mods for Games like KSP BeamNG and Minecraft, I'm starting with a simple webpage simulation for my educational webpage for my other project (Student Test Development)

# Goals
- Create a simple Physics simulation/visualiser webpage to build from
- 2D with colision and object selector
- Complex shapes, educational overlays
- Learning logic in JS (instead of writing code from webistes without understanding
- Light, mirrors, simple ray tracing (ish)
- Shapes that break apart or warp with force
- Implement
- Start to branch out into 3D simulation
  
- End goal - Modding into games, In the future understanding enough to poteinally build a simple engine.
